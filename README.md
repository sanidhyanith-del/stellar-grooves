# Stellar Grooves

A self-hosted, multi-user music library for rock and metal collections — built around **smart playlists you can share as queries**. Scan local directories for audio files, auto-categorize tracks by sub-genre, build smart playlists with a focused query DSL (and reusable `@phrase` fragments), publish them so other curators can run your queries against their own libraries, manage regular playlists with drag-drop reordering, rate your favorites, resolve duplicates, and stream everything in the browser with a retro jukebox-themed UI. Installable as a Progressive Web App on desktop and mobile.

Built with Spring Boot, MongoDB, and vanilla JavaScript.

> **A curator's library.** Write a smart playlist, publish the share link, and other curators run your *query* against their *own* libraries — they only ever see tracks they themselves own.

## Features

### Library & Playback
- **Directory scanning** — recursively finds audio files (`.mp3`, `.flac`, `.m4a` by default; configurable via `SCAN_SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS`) and extracts metadata (artist, album, title, year, cover art) via JAudioTagger; computes SHA-256 file hashes for exact duplicate detection; configurable scan depth limit; symlink-safe; per-file timeout prevents corrupt files from stalling the scan
- **Real-time scan progress** — SSE endpoint streams live progress (files imported, skipped, errors) to the browser during scanning
- **Per-user scan rate limiting** — configurable cooldown between scans (default 60s) to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Auto genre classification** — customizable JSON catalog of 80+ rock/metal artists spanning the 1960s-2020s, mapping to Classic Rock, Hard Rock, Hair Metal, Heavy Metal, and Thrash Metal; user genre corrections are persisted and override the static catalog for future scans
- **Duplicate detection & resolution** — skips files already imported by both file path and metadata (title + artist); paginated duplicates view to compare and delete duplicate tracks; optional file-hash–based duplicate detection to find exact copies regardless of metadata differences
- **In-browser playback** — persistent audio player bar with play/pause, seek, volume, shuffle, and album art display; HTTP Range support for seeking in large files; auto-advances to next track
- **Crossfade & gapless playback** — toggle crossfade (3-second fade between tracks) for seamless listening; uses dual audio elements for smooth transitions
- **Queue management** — add tracks to an "Up Next" queue; queue drains before sequential/shuffle playback resumes; clear queue with one click; queue persists to MongoDB across sessions and devices (falls back to localStorage); track ownership validated on save; real-time sync across tabs/devices via WebSocket (STOMP over SockJS)
- **Media Session integration** — lock screen and notification controls (play/pause/skip/seek) with track metadata and album art on mobile and desktop; syncs playback position for OS-level progress bars
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Space to play/pause, left/right arrows to seek, up/down for volume (active when player is visible and no input is focused)
- **Audio transcoding** — on-the-fly FLAC/M4A to MP3 conversion via ffmpeg; request `?format=mp3` on the transcode endpoint; gracefully degrades if ffmpeg is not installed
- **Scheduled scans** — configure a cron expression and directory path per user; the system checks every 60 seconds and triggers scans when due

### Smart Playlists & Curation
- **Smart playlists** — saved queries written in a focused DSL (`genre:hard_rock rating:>=4 lastPlayed:>1y sort:random limit:25`). Supported fields: `artist`, `album`, `title` (text contains), `genre`, `year`, `rating`, `playCount` (numeric with `=`/`>`/`>=`/`<`/`<=`/`low..high`), `tag`, and `lastPlayed:<7d` / `lastPlayed:>1mo` time windows. Boolean composition with `AND`/`OR`/parens, `-` for negation, top-level `sort:` (with `random`) and `limit:` clauses
- **Phrases** — name a query fragment once and reuse it everywhere via `@phrase-name`; phrases compose other phrases; cycle detection, max-depth, and max-resolutions guards keep expansion bounded
- **Smart playlist preview & match count** — dry-run any query (saved or unsaved) to see results and a count before committing
- **Materialize** — snapshot a smart playlist's current matches into a regular (static) playlist for export or for sharing audio
- **Smart playlist sharing (query sharing, not audio)** — the curator publishes a public link; subscribers run the *curator's query* against their *own library*. Subscribers only see tracks they themselves own. Subscriber count is visible to the curator
- **Subscribe by link** — paste a `/shared/smart-playlists/{token}` URL to add a curator's playlist to your sidebar
- **Fork** — copy a curator's query into your own editable smart playlist; forks are independent of later curator edits; if the source has been deleted, fork falls back to the last known query body
- **Source-deleted state** — if a curator deletes a shared playlist, subscribers see a "source deleted" badge but the cached query keeps working until they fork or unsubscribe
- **Listening rediscovery** — pre-built queries surface tracks you've forgotten about: high-rated-not-played-recently, high-rated-low-play-count, and one-track-only artists

### Organization & Search
- **Full-text search** — MongoDB text index across title (3x weight), artist (2x), and album (1x) with relevance scoring; falls back to regex search when text index is unavailable
- **Playlist management** — create playlists, add/remove tracks, drag-drop reorder tracks, sort by title/artist/album/genre/rating/year, export as M3U or JSON; share playlists via read-only links
- **Custom tags** — apply free-form tags to tracks (e.g. `live`, `acoustic`, `road-trip`) with bulk add/remove across up to 1000 files; tag listing with usage counts; tags are searchable in smart-playlist queries via `tag:value`
- **Library export** — download full library metadata as JSON or CSV for backup
- **Backup & restore** — full library backup (tracks, playlists, ratings, genre corrections, file hashes) as a single portable JSON file; restore on any instance to recreate your library metadata and playlists
- **Library statistics** — genre distribution, top 10 artists, decade distribution, and average rating via MongoDB aggregation
- **Soft delete / trash** — deleted tracks go to a 30-day trash instead of being permanently removed; restore or permanently delete from trash; paginated trash listing
- **Advanced filtering** — simultaneous artist, album, and genre dropdown filters alongside full-text search; all filters combine with AND logic
- **Browse views** — drill-down by artist, album, and genre; album grid view with cover art thumbnails (toggleable to list view); sortable columns including rating and decade
- **Bulk operations** — checkbox selection with select-all toggle; bulk delete and bulk add-to-playlist
- **User ratings** — 5-star rating widget on each track; sortable by rating
- **Inline genre editing** — reclassify any track tagged as "Other" directly from the library table
- **Play history tracking** — every track that reaches 50% of its duration (or plays to completion) is recorded as a `PlayEvent`; per-track play counts and last-played timestamps are denormalized onto each track; seeks are excluded from listened-time via a wall-clock vs playback-position check
- **Listening History view** — dedicated sidebar entry surfacing Recently Played, Top Tracks, and Top Artists; each tab supports a time window (All Time / 7 Days / 30 Days / Last Year); Top Artists rows drill into the artist's albums; aggregations backed by `$group` over `PlayEvent`
- **Virtual scrolling** — DOM virtualization kicks in at 250+ tracks; only visible rows are rendered, supporting libraries with 10,000+ tracks

### Administration & Security
- **Multi-user** — per-user libraries with session-based (form login) and JWT authentication; 15-minute access tokens with 7-day refresh tokens; 30-minute idle session timeout (configurable via `SESSION_TIMEOUT`)
- **Email verification** — optional email verification on signup (enable with `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=true`); 24-hour verification tokens; resend verification endpoint; login blocked until verified; anti-enumeration responses
- **Password reset** — token-based password reset flow with 15-minute one-time-use tokens; tokens are SHA-256 hashed before storage (raw token never persisted); anti-enumeration response (always returns 200)
- **Account lockout** — accounts lock after 5 consecutive failed login attempts; auto-unlocks after 15 minutes; configurable thresholds; all refresh tokens are revoked on lockout
- **Admin dashboard** — stats overview (users, files, playlists), paginated user management table with per-user file counts, delete user with cascade
- **Distributed rate limiting** — pluggable `RateLimitStore` interface with in-memory (default) and Redis-backed implementations; auto-detects Redis on the classpath for multi-instance deployments
- **Cover art storage quotas** — configurable per-user cover art quota (default 500 MB); quota checked during scan, extraction skipped when exceeded
- **Request body size limits** — Tomcat max post size, max header size, and multipart limits configured to prevent oversized payloads
- **Optimistic locking** — playlists use `@Version`-based optimistic locking to prevent lost updates from concurrent modifications; conflicts return 409 with a retry prompt
- **Per-user scan locking** — only one scan can run per user at a time; concurrent scan attempts are rejected, preventing cover art quota race conditions
- **Security** — CSRF protection (HttpOnly cookies with meta-tag delivery), rate limiting on auth and scan endpoints (with proxy-aware IP detection, trusted proxy validation, and `Retry-After` header), stricter IP-based rate limiting on login/signup endpoints (separate bucket, default 5 req/min), configurable CORS origins (explicit origins, not patterns), path traversal prevention on scan and stream endpoints, symlink detection, server-side input validation with typed DTOs and `@Size`/`@Pattern` constraints on search and scan parameters, Content Security Policy headers (no `unsafe-inline` for scripts), Permissions-Policy header (disables geolocation, microphone, camera, payment, USB), password complexity requirements (enforced on both signup and password reset), case-insensitive username normalization (prevents `User`/`user` duplicates), JWT with `jti`/`iss` claims and full role propagation on token refresh, token blacklisting on both logout and refresh, regex search query timeout (5s) and length limit (200 chars)
- **RFC 7807 error responses** — all API error responses follow the Problem Details standard (`type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`) with backwards-compatible `error` property
- **Audit logging** — dedicated `AUDIT` logger routed to a separate `logs/audit.log` file with 90-day retention; structured MDC context tracks all security-sensitive operations: logins, signups, password resets, file deletions, genre changes, playlist modifications, and admin actions
- **API documentation** — interactive Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html` with OpenAPI 3.0 spec at `/api-docs`; JWT bearer auth support; disabled in production profile
- **API versioning** — all REST endpoints under `/api/v1/` for forward compatibility
- **Structured logging** — correlation IDs on every request (`X-Correlation-Id` header), MDC-based log pattern for request tracing; optional JSON log output for production via Logstash encoder (activate with `json-logging` profile); client-side correlation IDs automatically sent in fetch headers for end-to-end tracing
- **Prometheus metrics** — `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint exposes application metrics (request counts, latencies, JVM stats) for Prometheus scraping; `/actuator/metrics` for JSON metric queries
- **Health check** — `/actuator/health` endpoint for monitoring; health details (including MongoDB connectivity) are only visible to authenticated users (`show-details=when-authorized`)

### UI & Accessibility
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — installable on desktop and mobile via "Add to Home Screen"; service worker caches static assets for instant loading with build-version-aware cache invalidation; offline fallback page when the network is unavailable; web app manifest with themed icons; cache-busted CSS/JS includes via version query parameters
- **Jukebox theme** — retro dark UI with neon glow effects, chrome accents, wood grain textures, and "Righteous" display typography
- **Light mode** — full light theme with manual toggle (sun/moon button in navbar); respects `prefers-color-scheme` media query; preference saved to localStorage
- **Loading states** — spinner feedback on genre changes, rating updates, bulk delete, add-to-playlist, and search operations
- **Toast notifications** — non-intrusive error and success toasts for all async operations (genre changes, rating updates, deletions, playlist actions, search failures)
- **Album art** — embedded cover art extracted during scan, displayed in the player bar, album grid view, and available via API
- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels on all interactive elements, `aria-sort` on sortable columns, `aria-pressed` on toggle buttons, `aria-live` regions for status updates and toast notifications, `aria-hidden` on decorative elements (equalizer canvas), `role="group"` on star rating widget, `role="button"` with keyboard handlers on drill-down rows and jukebox side items, modal focus management (auto-focus first element on open), `:focus-visible` outlines for keyboard navigation, keyboard-navigable sort headers, `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- **Performance monitoring** — Web Vitals reporting (LCP, FID, CLS) via PerformanceObserver API; virtual scrolling for libraries with 250+ tracks
- **Responsive design** — mobile-first layout with Bootstrap 5.3; columns hide on small screens; track action buttons visible on touch devices (no hover required)

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Java JDK | 17+ | [Adoptium Temurin](https://adoptium.net) recommended |
| Apache Maven | 3.6+ | Or use `mvn` if installed globally |
| MongoDB | 6.0+ | Must be running before the app starts |
| ffmpeg | 5.0+ | *Optional* — required only for audio transcoding (`/transcode` endpoint) |

### Installing MongoDB

**macOS (Homebrew)**
```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community
```

**Ubuntu / Debian**
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb
sudo systemctl start mongodb
```

**Windows**

Download the MSI installer from [mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community), then start the service:
```powershell
net start MongoDB
```

No additional database setup is needed — MongoDB creates the database and collections automatically on first run.

---

## Quick Start

A `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is **required** to start the app. Generate one with:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)
```

Then run:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd stellar-grooves

# Run with Maven (development)
JWT_SECRET=$JWT_SECRET mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

Windows:
```powershell
$env:JWT_SECRET = [Convert]::ToBase64String((1..64 | ForEach-Object { Get-Random -Max 256 }) -as [byte[]])
mvn spring-boot:run "-Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev"
```

The app starts at **http://localhost:8080**.

### Docker

The fastest way to get started — requires only Docker:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64) docker compose up --build
```

`JWT_SECRET` is **required** — Docker Compose will fail immediately if it is not set. This starts the app and MongoDB together with hardened container security (`no-new-privileges`, dropped capabilities, read-only root filesystem). Set `MUSIC_DIR` to mount your music library:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=$JWT_SECRET MUSIC_DIR=/path/to/your/music docker compose up --build
```

To enable Redis-backed distributed rate limiting, uncomment the `redis` service in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Build a JAR (production)

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
JWT_SECRET=$JWT_SECRET java -jar target/stellar-grooves-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

### Run tests

```bash
# Backend (Java)
mvn test                    # Unit tests only
mvn verify                  # Unit tests + JaCoCo coverage check + OWASP dependency check
mvn test -Dtest='*IT'       # Integration tests only (requires Docker for Testcontainers)

# Frontend (JavaScript)
npm test                    # Vitest unit tests (helpers, filtering, crossfade, virtual scroll)
npm run test:watch          # Vitest in watch mode
```

Backend tests generate a JaCoCo coverage report at `target/site/jacoco/index.html`.

### Check code formatting

```bash
mvn spotless:check      # verify formatting
mvn spotless:apply      # auto-fix formatting
```

> **Note:** Email verification requires `MAIL_ENABLED=true` and valid SMTP settings. When mail is disabled, verification tokens are logged at INFO level for development use.

### Spring Profiles

| Profile | Activate with | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `dev` | `--spring.profiles.active=dev` | Debug logging, Thymeleaf cache disabled, CORS allows `localhost:8080`, Swagger enabled |
| `prod` | `--spring.profiles.active=prod` | INFO logging, requires `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var, trusts proxy headers from configured IPs, Swagger disabled, audit + app logs written to files |
| `json-logging` | `--spring.profiles.active=prod,json-logging` | Structured JSON console output via Logstash encoder; use with `prod` for centralized log aggregation (ELK, Grafana Loki) |
| `file-logging` | `--spring.profiles.active=dev,file-logging` | Force rolling file appenders for app + audit logs even outside `prod` (useful in dev when you need persistent logs without enabling the full prod profile) |

When no profile is active, the base `application.properties` defaults apply.

**Example — production deployment:**
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo-host:27017/grooves \
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64) \
PORT=9090 \
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://myapp.example.com \
RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_PROXY=true \
RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_PROXIES=127.0.0.1,::1 \
ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme \
java -jar target/stellar-grooves-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

**Example — production with structured JSON logs (for ELK/Loki):**
```bash
java -jar target/stellar-grooves-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod,json-logging
```

> **Security note:** `JWT_SECRET` is required. Generate a strong Base64-encoded key (minimum 32 bytes decoded) with `openssl rand -base64 64`.

### Admin User

On first startup, you can create an admin user via environment variables:

```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme java -jar target/stellar-grooves-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(none — required)* | Password for the initial admin user |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Username for the admin user |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@stellargrooves.local` | Email for the admin user |

The admin is only created if no admin user already exists. If a user with the given username exists but lacks the admin role, they are promoted.

### Redis (Optional — Distributed Rate Limiting)

When `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` is on the classpath and a Redis instance is available, rate limiting automatically switches from in-memory to Redis-backed. This enables consistent rate limiting across multiple app instances.

```bash
# application.properties or env vars
spring.data.redis.host=localhost
spring.data.redis.port=6379
```

With Docker Compose, uncomment the `redis` service block.

### Custom Artist Catalog

The artist-genre mapping is stored in `src/main/resources/catalog.json`. To customize without recompiling, create your own JSON file and point to it:

```bash
stellar.grooves.catalogPath=/path/to/my-catalog.json \
java -jar target/stellar-grooves-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The JSON format maps artist names to arrays of genre values:
```json
{
  "Artist Name": ["CLASSIC_ROCK", "HARD_ROCK"],
  "Another Band": ["THRASH_METAL"]
}
```

**Genre corrections:** When a user changes a track's genre in the UI, that correction is stored in MongoDB and takes precedence over the static catalog for future scans. This means the catalog effectively "learns" from user corrections without editing the JSON file.

---

## First Use

1. Open **http://localhost:8080/signup** and create an account.
2. Log in at **http://localhost:8080/login**.
3. Enter the absolute path to a music directory (e.g. `/home/user/Music`) and click **Start Scan**.
4. Watch real-time progress as files are scanned, imported, and categorized.
5. Tracks appear in the library with extracted metadata, genre classification, and album art.
6. Click the play button on any row to start streaming. Use keyboard shortcuts (Space, arrows) to control playback.
7. Toggle crossfade with the sparkle button for smooth transitions between tracks.
8. Use the artist, album, and genre filter dropdowns or the search box to find tracks.
9. Rate tracks with the 5-star widget. Sort by any column including rating.
10. Create playlists from the sidebar, add tracks via the "+" button, and reorder with drag-drop.
11. Create a **Smart Playlist** with a query like `genre:hard_rock rating:>=4 sort:rating:desc limit:50` — see [HOW_TO_USE.md](HOW_TO_USE.md) for the full DSL.
12. Define reusable `@phrase` fragments and reference them from any smart playlist (`@road-trip rating:>=4`).
13. Share a smart playlist — subscribers run *your* query against *their* library; or fork it into their own editable copy.
14. Share a regular playlist via the share button — generates a read-only public link.
15. Select multiple tracks with checkboxes for bulk delete or bulk add-to-playlist.
16. Deleted tracks go to trash — restore them or empty trash to permanently remove.
17. Click the "Duplicated Songs" stat card to review and resolve duplicate tracks (paginated).
18. Export playlists as M3U or JSON, or export your entire library as JSON/CSV from the library view.
19. Use the hash-based duplicates view to find exact file copies across different folders.
20. Back up your entire library (tracks + playlists + ratings + smart playlists + phrases) via the backup endpoint — restore it on any instance.
21. Set up a scheduled scan to auto-import new files on a cron schedule.
22. Open the **Listening History** sidebar entry for Recently Played, Top Tracks, and Top Artists across configurable time windows.
23. Open **Rediscover** to surface forgotten tracks, neglected favorites, and one-hit-wonder artists from your library.
24. Apply custom **Tags** (e.g. `live`, `acoustic`) and use them in smart-playlist queries with `tag:live`.
25. Toggle light/dark mode with the sun/moon button in the navbar.
26. Admin users can access the admin dashboard at **/admin** to manage users.
27. Install the app as a PWA from the browser's install prompt for a standalone experience.
28. Visit **/help** for the built-in user guide — accessible from the navbar, login, and signup pages (no login required).
29. Browse the interactive API documentation at **/swagger-ui.html** (dev mode only).

## Monitoring

A health endpoint is available at `/actuator/health` (no authentication required). It reports basic application status. Detailed health information (including MongoDB connectivity) is only shown to authenticated users (`show-details=when-authorized`).

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
# {"status":"UP"}
```

Prometheus metrics are exposed at `/actuator/prometheus` for scraping, and JSON metrics at `/actuator/metrics`.

---

## Operations & Hardening

A short checklist for self-hosters running Stellar Grooves on a public network.

**Required before exposing the app to the internet:**

- **Run with the `prod` profile**: `--spring.profiles.active=prod` (or `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`). This disables Swagger/OpenAPI, tightens logging, and trusts proxy headers from the configured trusted-proxy list.
- **Set `JWT_SECRET`** to a Base64-encoded value of at least 256 bits. The app refuses to start in `prod` without it. Generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- **Set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** to the exact origins that should be allowed (comma-separated). The app refuses to start in `prod` if this is empty.
- **Set `MONGO_URI`** to a MongoDB instance with authentication enabled. Don't expose MongoDB to the public internet.
- **Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD`** on first startup so the bootstrap admin user has a strong password (the bootstrap process logs whether it created a new admin or promoted an existing user).
- **Set `SCAN_ALLOWED_BASE_DIRS`** (comma-separated) to restrict where the scanner can read from — paths outside the allowlist are rejected. Recommended even on single-tenant deployments.

**Reverse proxy and TLS:**

- Terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, Traefik). HSTS is already enabled by the application security config; the proxy should also send HSTS headers and redirect HTTP → HTTPS.
- **Restrict `/actuator/*`** at the proxy. The app exposes `/actuator/health` (anonymous, basic status only) and `/actuator/prometheus` + `/actuator/metrics`. Restrict the latter two to trusted IPs (your scrape target) or strip them from public traffic.
- Configure `RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_PROXIES` to your reverse-proxy IPs so the rate limiter sees real client IPs from `X-Forwarded-For` instead of the proxy's IP.

**Container and process:**

- The provided `Dockerfile` already runs as a non-root user. If you build your own image, preserve that.
- Mount music libraries **read-only** (`:ro`) into the container; the scanner doesn't need write access.
- Persist MongoDB data on a backed-up volume. The library catalog can be rescanned, but user accounts, playlists, listening history, and smart-playlist definitions cannot.

**Updates:**

- Watch GitHub releases for security patches. Dependabot is enabled in this repo for Maven, npm, and GitHub Actions ecosystems.

## REST API

> **Interactive docs:** Browse the full API at [/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) when the app is running. The OpenAPI spec is available at `/api-docs`.

All endpoints under `/api/v1/library/*`, `/api/v1/playlists/*`, and `/api/v1/admin/*` require authentication. Use the session cookie from form login, or pass a JWT via the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header (obtained from `/api/v1/auth/signin`).

Session-authenticated requests (form login) must include the CSRF token header for any mutating request (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). The token is available from `<meta name="_csrf">` tags in Thymeleaf pages, or from the HttpOnly `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie for non-browser clients.

Login/signup endpoints are rate-limited to 5 requests per minute per IP. Other auth endpoints are limited to 10 per minute. Scan endpoints have a per-user cooldown (default 60s). Rate-limited responses include a `Retry-After` header.

All error responses follow [RFC 7807 Problem Details](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807) format with `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, and an `error` property for backwards compatibility.

**700+ tests** across backend (controllers, services, security, smart-playlist DSL) and a focused Vitest suite for pure-utility frontend helpers. JaCoCo coverage reports generated at `target/site/jacoco/index.html` with a **60% minimum line coverage** threshold enforced at the `verify` phase. Broader frontend test coverage (DOM-level integration) is open for contribution.

## Native Installer (Optional)

Requires `jpackage` (bundled with JDK 14+). Build the JAR first, then:

**macOS**
```bash
jpackage --type app-image \
  --input target/ \
  --main-jar stellar-grooves-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --main-class com.stellarideas.grooves.StellarGroovesApplication \
  --name "StellarGrooves"
```

**Windows**
```powershell
jpackage --type exe `
  --input target/ `
  --main-jar stellar-grooves-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar `
  --main-class com.stellarideas.grooves.StellarGroovesApplication `
  --name "StellarGrooves" `
  --win-shortcut --win-menu
```

> MongoDB must still be running on the target machine.
